              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                Our e-learning platform was born out of a shared vision and
                passion for transforming education. It all began with a group of
                educators, technologists, and lifelong learners who recognized
                the need for accessible, flexible, and high-quality learning
                opportunities in a rapidly evolving digital world.
              </p>
              <p className="text-base font-medium text-richblack-300 lg:w-[95%]">
                As experienced educators ourselves, we witnessed firsthand the
                limitations and challenges of traditional education systems. We
                believed that education should not be confined to the walls of a
                classroom or restricted by geographical boundaries. We
                envisioned a platform that could bridge these gaps and empower
                individuals from all walks of life to unlock their full
                potential.
